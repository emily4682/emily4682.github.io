            <p id="shortSummary"> 
                At Serco, I joined the RPA (Robotic Process Automation) team during a 4-week work experience placement. During this time, I worked on traning modules for UiPath & Boomi, completed personal projects, developed a partial project for Serco, completed a site visit, and sat in on team & client meetings. <br><br>
                The outcome of this project was the development of a RPA solution that will be used by Serco in the future. It involved developing an automated bot to take data from a Microfot PowerApp to Assure (an internal incident reporting platform). The project included adding error handling and retries when necessary in order to make an efficient and reliable solution. <br><br>
                This experience allowed me to develop new skills, learn how a business functions, further my understanding of the developer-client relationship and become familar with new software.

            <button class="mainButton" id="extendedSummary" onclick="DisplaySummary()"> See Extended Summary </button>

            <p id="extendedSummaryContent" style="display: none;"> The RPA Team works with Serco's external customer contracts and internally within Serco. They work on building automated bots that can assist employees with everyday, repetitive tasks. They mainly use UiPath and Boomi to develop these solutions - both of which I had not used before. <br><br>
                The first two weeks of this work experience were spent familiarising myself with the team and how they operate, I was able to sit in on meetings - these included team meetings and meetings with clients. I also focused on training modules provided by the UiPath and Boomi platforms so that I had the knowledge and skills to start development on actual projects. <br><br>
                During the third week, I worked on some more complex personal projects using UiPath while I waited to gain access to the actual project. This included an Outlook Mailbox Sorter and a Payslip Generator. By the end of the week, I was able to start reviewing the process map and documentation for the project I would be working on. <br><br>
                In the fourth week I started development on the main project, which involved automating the process of reporting safety observations in the workplace. The bot had to take the data from one system and export that to Serco's incidemt reporting platform. I was able to complete a large portion of the project I had been assigned in this last week. I also took part in a site visit to one of Serco's contracts which allowed me to see how the solutions we build as developers have real-life impacts. <br><br>
                This experience was extremely valuable and inisghtful, I learnt how a business operates and and how to work with a client when developing a project. I also got hands-on experience of agile methodologies during the site visit as we could see various improvements for further iterations of some automated processes.
