            <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Emily! I'm a second-year computer science student at the University of Sheffield. I'm passionate about learning new skills in technology and other fields and applying them to real-life circumstances. <br><br>
                I'm hoping to undertake an industrial placement year during my 3rd year at university as I believe this will provide me with invaluable experience and knowledge as I navigate the job market once I graduate. <br><br>
                At university, my main focus is programming. I love applying my problem-solving skills to real-life development and I hope to work in this field after graduation! <br><br>

            <h1> My Projects </h1>
            <p> 
                During my studies, work experience, and outside of school, I've completed several coding projects to help advance my knowledge. <br><br>
                Throughout these projects, I've used a variety of languages, firstly to aid with my studies and also for my own enjoyment. <br><br>
                I've also started taking part in Leetcode challenges, these can be found on my leetcode profile.

            <p id="shortSummary"> 
                At Serco, I joined the RPA (Robotic Process Automation) team during a 4-week work experience placement. During this time, I worked on traning modules for UiPath & Boomi, completed personal projects, developed a partial project for Serco, completed a site visit, and sat in on team & client meetings. <br><br>
                The outcome of this project was the development of a RPA solution that will be used by Serco in the future. It involved developing an automated bot to take data from a Microfot PowerApp to Assure (an internal incident reporting platform). The project included adding error handling and retries when necessary in order to make an efficient and reliable solution. <br><br>
                This experience allowed me to develop new skills, learn how a business functions, further my understanding of the developer-client relationship and become familar with new software.
