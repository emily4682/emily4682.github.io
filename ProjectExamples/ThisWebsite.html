            <p> 
                I developed this website myself in order to have a plaform for me to put my projects on display, this was important for me as I prepare for my industrial placement applications <br><br>
                This site is mainly done through HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript. I used GitHub pages in order to host my website! <br><br>
                I wanted to create a sophisticated, modern looking website that was simple and easy to read. I kept to a small number of pages and made sure navigation was simple to allow users to interact with my site. <br><br>
                I used git to push my changes to my live website and I used Git LFS to store larger files that couldn't just be committed to git.
