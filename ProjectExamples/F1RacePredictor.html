            <p>
                This was a project I completed over the summer, it is my first attempt at a machine learning program. <br><br>
                It takes in data about previous races and finds the relation between certain factors and a driver winning a race. This is used to train the machine learning model (I used a polynomial regression model). <br><br>
                Data about a race, such as the starting position and current championship place, can be added into the model via a user interface. <br><br>
                The model will then predict the likelihood of each driver in the race winning. The driver with the highest probability will be the predicted winner. <br><br>
                The model was trained with over 26,000 previous race results and the model had an RMSE value of 0.1644 (an accuracy of around 84%). Using a polynomial regression model was more accurate than a linear model by 0.97%. The results will never be able to be 100% reliable (or near to 100%) due to the unpredictable nature of F1 races. <br><br>
