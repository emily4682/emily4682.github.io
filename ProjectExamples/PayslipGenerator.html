            <p> 
                This project was developed as part of my work experience with Serco. I built this in UiPath which is a piece of software used for RPA automations. <br><br>
                This bot will read in data from an excel file and perform calculations and formatting on that data to produce and eventually email a payslip to each employee on the list. <br><br>
                This process can currently process 3 types of payslips - UK, USA & Belgian Payslips. The bot will calculate all taxes, total income (holiday, sick leave etc..) and any other outgoing payments such as student loan repayments. <br><br>
                Once calculated, the data is formatted into a PDF and that PDF is sent out to the employee's email address.
