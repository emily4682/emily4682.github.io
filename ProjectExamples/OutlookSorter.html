            <h3> Description: </h3>
            <p> 
                This project was developed as part of my work experience with Serco. I built this in UiPath which is a piece of software used for RPA automations. <br><br>
                The bot will go through each email in an outlook inbox and move the email to the correct folder based on the email's sender. If the folder doesn't exist, the bot will create it and then keep a log of all created folders in an excel sheet. The excel sheet can then be refrenced when the bot is figuring out if the folder exists, this is much more efficient than getting the bot to search through your outlook folder list. <br><br>
                There is also an excel sheet read in that contains a list of companies I wish to have a parent folder for. The parent folder could be something like Microsoft and each email containing @microsoft.co.uk will have it's own subfolder created inside the parent folder. This allows for better organision <br><br>
