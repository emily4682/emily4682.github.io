            <p> 
                This project was developed as part of my work experience with Serco. I built this in UiPath which is a piece of software used for RPA automations. <br><br>
                The bot needed to go into the Microsoft Power App used by on-site employees (used to report safety incidents) and extract that data. Then for each report, export the data into Assure (Serco's internal incident reporting platform).
                Building this process was done in iterations to slowly make the process more efficient and reliable. I also incorportated error handling into this process. <br><br>
                I was able to increse the bot's reliability by adding reties where necessary. This led to the number of failures greatly reducing. <br><br>
                This bot will be used by Serco in the future.
